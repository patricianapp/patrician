## Amazon Aurora

- **What is it?** A proprietary cloud database service that has compatibility with Postgres and MySQL clients.
- **What do we use it for?** The Patrician database that stores user and item info.
- **Alternatives:** Amazon DocumentDB (if we wanted to use a MongoDB client instead), or a typical managed Postgres service like Digital Ocean Databases.

## AWS Lambda

- **What is it?** Cloud runtime for executing functions on-demand, either via an API endpoint or through other AWS services.
- **What do we use it for?** Nothing yet, but this is most likely where we will put the "importer" functions that import large libraries from Last.fm, Spotify, etc. because we don't want that work clogging up the main thread that our server runs on.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Google Firebase Cloud Functions: This would be a nice solution, but right now it's heavily tied to Node.js, and we might eventually want to write these functions in other languages. (Lambda, by comparison, supports Java, Go, PowerShell, Node. js, C#, Python, and Ruby.)

## Digital Ocean

## Docker

- **What is it?** A virtualization tool that allows applications to run anywhere that has Docker installed.
- **What do we use it for?** I'm not 100% convinced that we need it, since Heroku can host Node.js applications without it, but this would enable our API to be very portable, and it would ease the dev experience for our team and for others who want to self-host Patrician instances.
- **Alternatives:** As of 2020, Docker is by and large an industry standard.

## ESLint

- **What is it?** A tool for automated "linting", which finds errors in our code, and in some cases attempts to auto-fix them.
- **What do we use it for?** Code checking on every commit, thanks to Husky and Lint-Staged.
- **Alternatives:** No real alternatives.

## Ghost

- **What is it?** A blogging platform/CMS, written in Node.js, that features an admin UI for creating accounts and writing posts.
- **What do we use it for?** Might use this for our public-facing blog where we demonstrate new app features. There's a [handy Heroku installer](https://github.com/SNathJr/ghost-on-heroku) that seems to work pretty well.
- **Alternatives:** Haven't done a huge amount of research on this yet. Wordpress would be an obvious alternative, but I'd like to use something more modern, and I really like the look and feel of Ghost in comparison.

## GitHub

- **What is it?** A hosting service for code that uses Git version control to keep track of history and collaboration between users.
- **What do we use it for?** Hosting all of our code, and keeping track of our tasks in the form of Issues.
- **Alternatives:** GitLab would also be an awesome choice, but GitHub is what most developers are used to (which makes it easier to find contributors), and it's also what my company uses, so it makes the most sense for this project.

## Hasura

- **What is it?** An open-source application that serves an autogenerated GraphQL endpoint for a Postgres database, complete with CRUD operations for all tables and integrations for server-side business logic.
- **What do we use it for?** Nothing at this point, however I was considering using this as our API instead of the Warthog application we're building. The main difference is that Hasura relies on the database layer for a lot of business logic, which would likely be faster due to Postgres's optimization. I decided against this, because it seemed like it would be a lot more work compared to our current option, and would likely allow for less customization of our business logic.
- **Alternatives:** The closest comparison to this would be Postgraphile, which I turned down for similar reasons. The alternative we've chosen for this project is our own TypeScript API that uses the Warthog framework (a wrapper for TypeORM/TypeGraphQL that reduces boilerplate and auto-generates some API functionality).

## Heroku

- **What is it?** A cloud platform for easily hosting applications in a number of languages/runtimes.
- **What do we use it for?** Hosting the Patrician API, and possibly our blog as well.
- **Alternatives:** There are several. The most similar to Heroku would probably be AWS Elastic Beanstalk, which also has a simple setup process. We could also self-manage a VPS using a service like Digital Ocean, or self-manage a Kubernetes cluster using EKS or Google Cloud. These are all options we can revisit at some point, but right now Heroku is the go-to for its simplicity, plugin architecture, and auto-scaling ability. Reasons to switch to something else could be for pricing, better scalability, higher speeds, integration with other services, logging, better CI/CD, and more.
